# Data-Mart

Data Dart is my latest venture and I want your help to analyze the sales and
performance of my venture. In June 2020 - large scale supply changes were made
at Data Mart. All Data Mart products now use sustainable packaging methods in
every single step from the farm all the way to the customer.
I need your help to quantify the impact of this change on the sales performance for
Data Mart and its separate business areas.
